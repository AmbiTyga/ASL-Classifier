This repository contains my analysis and the project on sign languages. In this repository I have used [ASL-sign language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language) which is a common sign language used by most of the communities.

## Sign Languages
Sign languages are languages that use the visual-manual modality to convey meaning. Sign languages are expressed through manual articulations in combination with non-manual elements. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language)
